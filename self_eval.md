# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel about your use of built-in Ruby methods? Good! I think I have a solid basic understanding of how to use them. 
- How confident do you feel writing simple methods of your own? Confident. 
- What questions do you have about methods, and what they are capable of? (ask a question!!!) How normal is it to write your own methods in the wild? Fairly common?
